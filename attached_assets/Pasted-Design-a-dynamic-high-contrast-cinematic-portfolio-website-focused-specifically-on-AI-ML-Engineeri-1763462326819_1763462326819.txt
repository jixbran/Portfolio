Design a dynamic, high-contrast, cinematic portfolio website focused specifically on AI/ML Engineering and Data Science. The target audience is recruiters for ML roles. Aesthetic & Mood: The design must be dark-themed, high-contrast, and minimalist, resembling a futuristic Tech Research Lab or a specialized AI product page (like DeepMind or NVIDIA). The mood should be highly analytical, precise, and technical. Use massive, elegant, monospace/technical typography and incorporate subtle background grid patterns or faint, abstract data visualizations (like node connections or glowing dots). Structure & Thematic Sections: Use a single-page vertical layout with distinct, full-screen scroll sections designed to impress: 1. Hero Section: Centerpiece name and title: AI/ML Engineer | Python & Computer Vision. The tagline should be a rotating text loop showcasing core competencies: Predictive Modeling, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, MLOps Readiness. 2. Core Projects (The Focus): This section must be the most visually dominant. Prioritize AI/ML: Showcase the IPL Analytics Engine and Pose Detection System. Use a technical, large-scale, split-screen layout (e.g., image/mockup on the left, clear results/metrics on the right) that emphasizes model performance (81% accuracy) and realtime application (MediaPipe). Secondary Project: Include the Content-Based Recommendation Engine with a focus on the NLP and ML pipeline used (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity). 3. Technical Deployment (The Capability): A smaller, dedicated section highlighting: MERN Stack Integration: Briefly mention the 6-week internship to show competency in deployment/frontend integration (React, Express.js), framing it as the ability to productionize models. 4. Skills Overview: A clean, horizontal scrollable list of specialized technologies: Python, Scikitlearn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, MediaPipe, OpenCV, Streamlit, Git. 5. Contact: A minimal contact block with a clear call-to-action: "Connect for ML Opportunities." Interactions & Motion (Crucial): The site must be defined by fluid, smooth motion and technical precision: 1. Scrolling: Implement buttery smooth vertical scrolling (cinematic scrolling) for a premium feel. 2. Depth Effect: Introduce subtle parallax effects on background visual elements (grids, data patterns) to create a sense of depth and movement. 3. Data Highlight: Use a unique on-hover animation over project cards where key metrics (e.g., "81% Accuracy") flash or glow briefly. 4. Micro-interactions: Implement crisp, physics-based micro-interactions on all primary navigation and buttons. 5. Animations: Use subtle, delayed fade-in/slide-up animations for content elements as they enter the viewport during scrolling (on-scroll animation). 6. Mobile: Maintain high-contrast readability and scroll fluidity, ensuring project metrics are clearly visible.
